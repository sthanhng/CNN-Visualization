## Visualizing Convolutional Layers

Convolutional neural networks are designed to work with image data, and their structure and function suggest that should be less inscrutable than other types of neural networks.

Both filters and feature maps can be visualized.

## Pre-trained VGG Model

We can load and summarize the VGG16 model with just a few lines of code:

```python
# Import the VGG16 model
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16

# Load the model
model = VGG16()
# Summarize the model
model.summary()
```
